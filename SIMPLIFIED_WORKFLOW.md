# 🎯 Simplified Security Workflow - SonarCloud Only

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Decision:** Focus on SonarCloud for unified code quality and security reporting

---

## ✅ What Changed

### Before:
- ❌ 6 separate security tools (SonarCloud, Snyk, Semgrep, Trivy, Gitleaks, Checkov)
- ❌ Results scattered across multiple platforms
- ❌ No single place to view aggregated reports
- ❌ Complex workflow maintenance

### After:
- ✅ **One workflow:** `security-sonarcloud.yml`
- ✅ **One platform:** SonarCloud
- ✅ **One dashboard:** https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/ayodeleoladeji/projects
- ✅ Simple, focused, easy to maintain

---

## 🗑️ Files Removed

1. `.github/workflows/security-snyk.yml` - Deleted
2. `.github/workflows/security-semgrep.yml` - Deleted
3. `.github/workflows/security-trivy.yml` - Deleted
4. `.github/workflows/security-gitleaks.yml` - Deleted
5. `.github/workflows/security-checkov.yml` - Deleted
6. `.github/workflows/security-sonarqube.yml` - Deleted (old combined version)

---

## ✅ What Remains

### Single Workflow:
**File:** `.github/workflows/security-sonarcloud.yml`

**Name:** `SonarCloud Analysis`

**What It Does:**
1. Analyzes all 3 Java services (backend, gateway, risk-engine)
2. Analyzes frontend (React/TypeScript)
3. Runs SpotBugs security analysis
4. Generates code coverage with JaCoCo
5. Uploads everything to SonarCloud
6. Provides quality gate enforcement

**Triggers:**
- Every push to any branch
- Every pull request
- Weekly schedule (Monday 2 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch

---

- **FAILED** ⚠️ - Issues need fixing before merge

### Severity Levels:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Fix immediately (security vulnerabilities)
- 🟠 **HIGH** - Fix soon (serious bugs)
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Plan to fix (quality issues)
- 🟢 **LOW** - Nice to have (minor improvements)

### Coverage:
- **80%+** ✅ - Excellent
- **60-80%** 🟡 - Good
- **40-60%** 🟠 - Needs improvement
- **<40%** 🔴 - Critical gap
