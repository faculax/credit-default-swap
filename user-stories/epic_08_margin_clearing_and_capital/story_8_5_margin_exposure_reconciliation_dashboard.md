# Story 8.5 ‚Äì Margin & Exposure Reconciliation Dashboard (Optional)

**As a risk operations manager**,  
I want a unified dashboard for margin and exposure reconciliation across all CCPs and counterparties  
So that I can monitor collateral positions, identify exceptions, and ensure regulatory compliance efficiently.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard displays aggregated VM, IM, and EAD metrics across all counterparties and CCPs.
- Real-time reconciliation status with exception highlighting and materiality thresholds.
- Trend analysis charts showing margin and exposure evolution over configurable periods.
- Exception workflow for investigating, documenting, and resolving reconciliation breaks.
- Automated alerting for threshold breaches, failed reconciliations, and significant changes.
- Export functionality for management reporting, regulatory submissions, and audit trails.
- User-configurable views with filtering by counterparty, CCP, asset class, and date range.
- Performance monitoring showing calculation times, data freshness, and system health.

## üß™ Dashboard Display Rules
| Metric | Display Rule |
|--------|--------------|
| VM Position | Show net position with directional indicators (owed to/from) |
| IM Requirement | Highlight breaches above warning thresholds |
| EAD Exposure | Color-code by risk tier and limit utilization |
| Reconciliation Status | Badge system with aging indicators for unresolved items |
| Data Freshness | Timestamp display with staleness warnings |

## üß† UX Notes
- Clean layout following `AGENTS.md` color scheme and accessibility guidelines.
- Responsive design supporting both desktop and mobile access.
- Interactive charts with drill-down capability to underlying trade details.

## üõ† Implementation Guidance
- Implement as optional module that can be enabled/disabled via feature flags.
- Use materialized views or caching for performance with large datasets.
- Consider WebSocket connections for real-time updates vs polling strategies.
- Implement progressive loading for historical data and large portfolios.

## üì¶ Deliverables
- React dashboard components with responsive layout.
- Backend aggregation services with caching and performance optimization.
- Exception workflow management with status tracking and audit trails.
- Export services supporting multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV).

## ‚è≠ Dependencies / Links
- Consumes data from Stories 8.1-8.4 (novation, statements, SIMM, SA-CCR).
- May require additional notification/alerting infrastructure setup.
