# Story 13.1 – Run Correlated Simulation

## Narrative
Enable triggering a correlated Monte Carlo simulation for a selected portfolio with configurable parameters and obtain a run identifier.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Placeholder – detailed acceptance to be refined during implementation.

## Implementation Notes
- Placeholder – engineer to refine.

## Test Scenarios
- Placeholder – add when implementing.

## UI / UX Acceptance (Provisional)
- Form inputs: paths, horizons multi-select, correlation model preset, stochastic recovery toggle (disabled Phase A), seed field.
- Run button initiating async job; disabled while running.
- Display returned runId upon queueing.
