# Story 4.6 â€“ Audit Logging & Error Handling

**As a compliance stakeholder**,  
I want credit event and settlement changes auditable with clear error signaling  
So that regulatory and investigative needs are met.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- All credit event creations + settlement creations write an audit row: id, entity_type, entity_id, action, timestamp, actor (user/system), summary.
- Errors return structured problem+json: type, title, status, detail, timestamp, correlation_id.
- Correlation ID generated per request (UUID) and returned in header `X-Correlation-Id` and error payload.
- Audit repository persisted in `cds_audit_log` table (append-only).
- On transaction rollback, no audit rows persist (except for dedicated error audit entries if later adopted â€“ out of scope now).
- Basic query endpoint (optional backlog) NOT required now.

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios
1. Successful credit event â†’ audit row present.
2. Duplicate event (idempotent) â†’ single audit row only (creation). No second row.
3. Validation failure â†’ structured error payload with correlation_id.
4. Settlement calculation success â†’ audit row.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Guidance
- Use Spring `HandlerInterceptor` or filter to inject correlation id into MDC.
- Service layer publishes audit helper method inside same transaction.
- Flyway migration for `cds_audit_log` (no updates/deletes, only inserts).
- Provide centralized `@ControllerAdvice` for exception mapping to problem+json.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
- Audit table migration + entity.
- Correlation ID filter/interceptor.
- Controller advice for errors.
- Tests verifying audit persistence + error payload schema.

## ðŸ”® Backlog Seeds
- Search/reporting endpoint.
- Integration with external observability platform.
