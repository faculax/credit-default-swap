# Story 4.2 â€“ Validate & Persist Credit Event

**As the system**,  
I need to validate an incoming credit event against trade eligibility rules  
So that only legitimate lifecycle events are recorded.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- Endpoint validates that trade exists and is ACTIVE.
- Reject if a prior terminal credit event already recorded (idempotency guard).
- Valid event types enforced via enum / lookup.
- Persistent storage in `cds_credit_events` with: id (UUID), trade_id, event_type, event_date, notice_date, settlement_method, comments, created_at.
- Duplicate (same trade_id + event_type + event_date) returns 200 with existing resource (graceful idempotency) â€“ no new row.
- On success, trade status transitions to CREDIT_EVENT_RECORDED (intermediate) unless auto-calculation moves it further.

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios
1. Unknown trade id â†’ 404.
2. Trade not ACTIVE â†’ 422 (validation error code schema TBD).
3. Duplicate event (same key fields) â†’ existing event returned.
4. Invalid event type â†’ 400.
5. Success persists row; trade status updated.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Guidance
- Service layer method: `recordCreditEvent(tradeId, dto)` returning event entity.
- Database uniqueness constraint: (trade_id, event_type, event_date).
- Map DTO â†’ entity; leverage JSR-303 for basic field validation.
- Wrap in transaction; on duplicate detection query existing.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
- Domain entity + JPA repository for credit event.
- Flyway migration creating `cds_credit_events`.
- Service + controller logic with idempotency.
- Unit + integration tests.

## ðŸ”® Backlog Seeds
- Pluggable validation rule engine.
- Audit trail enhancements (see Story 4.6).
