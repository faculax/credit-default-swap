# Quick Answer: GitHub Actions Auto-Run Setup

## âœ… Already Configured!

Your security pipeline is **already set up** to run automatically on GitHub.

## When It Runs

### 1. On ANY Branch Push âœ…
```bash
git push origin <any-branch>
```
âœ“ Triggers immediately after push  
âœ“ Runs all security checks  
âœ“ Shows results in GitHub Actions tab

### 2. On Pull Requests
```bash
# When you create a PR to main or develop
```
âœ“ Prevents merging if checks fail  
âœ“ Shows status in PR

### 3. Daily Schedule
```bash
# Automatically at 2 AM UTC every day
```
âœ“ Catches new vulnerabilities  
âœ“ No action needed

## How to See It Working

### Step 1: Push Your Code
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add security analysis"
git push origin security-compliance
```

### Step 2: Go to GitHub
1. Open: `https://github.com/faculax/credit-default-swap`
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. See your workflow running!

### Step 3: Check Results
- âœ“ Green = All good
- âš  Yellow = Warnings (review)
- âœ— Red = Failed (must fix)

## Configuration File

**Location**: `.github/workflows/cds-security-quality.yml`

**Current Settings**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ '**' ]  # ALL branches âœ“
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily
```

## What Gets Checked

âœ“ Secret scanning  
âœ“ Java security (SpotBugs, OWASP)  
âœ“ Frontend security (ESLint)  
âœ“ Dependency vulnerabilities  
âœ“ Code quality  
âœ“ Docker security
