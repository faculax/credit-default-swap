description: you are a developer, working in a local env, frontend is running using npm start, asume is always running and does not need to be restarted, you can run npm build to check your changes, backend and gateway are always running using mvn spring boot run, ask me if i need to bounce them, you can test your changes with mvn clean install, not wmvn. risk engine and the db are running using docker compose, just those two, youre free to re build and bounce those images, but not the full docker compose file, please dont write summary documents when doing something. after implementing something, the last thing you need to tell me is what services do i need to bounce. when creating ui components, always mantain the existing look and feel of the app, no new colours, no white forms.
