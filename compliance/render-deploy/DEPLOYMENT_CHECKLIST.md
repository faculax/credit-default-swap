# ðŸš€ Pre-Deployment Checklist

## Before Deploying to Render

### 1. Configuration Review
- [ ] Updated `DD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in render.yaml or plan to set in dashboard
- [ ] Reviewed all environment variables in render.yaml
- [ ] Set `DD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to non-default value (via Render dashboard after deploy)
- [ ] Chose appropriate Render plan (Standard minimum recommended)
- [ ] Selected appropriate disk size (10GB default, adjust if needed)

### 2. File Verification
- [ ] All files present: Dockerfile, init-db.sh, supervisord.conf, uwsgi.ini, nginx.conf, health-check.sh, render.yaml
- [ ] All shell scripts have execute permissions (handled by Dockerfile)
- [ ] No sensitive data committed to repository

### 3. Security Verification
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords in any files
- [ ] render.yaml uses `generateValue: true` for secrets
- [ ] render.yaml uses `sync: false` for sensitive values
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement configured (DD_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True)
- [ ] Security headers present in nginx.conf

### 4. Repository Setup
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] Repository connected to Render account
- [ ] render.yaml in correct path (compliance/render-deploy/)

## During Deployment

### 5. Monitor Build Process
- [ ] Watch build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify all apt packages install successfully
- [ ] Confirm DefectDojo source clone succeeds
- [ ] Check Python dependencies install without errors
- [ ] Note any warnings (some are expected)

Expected build time: **10-15 minutes** first deployment

### 6. Monitor Initialization
- [ ] Watch for "Starting DefectDojo initialization..." message
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL initialization completes
- [ ] Verify Redis starts successfully
- [ ] Confirm Django migrations run without errors
- [ ] Check static files collection succeeds
- [ ] Verify superuser creation

Expected initialization time: **2-3 minutes**

### 7. Health Check Validation
- [ ] Service shows "Live" status (not restarting)
- [ ] No repeated restart loops
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200

## After Deployment

### 8. Access Verification
- [ ] Can access DefectDojo URL (https://your-app.onrender.com)
- [ ] Login page loads with proper styling
- [ ] Can login with admin credentials
- [ ] Dashboard loads successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

### 9. Functional Testing
- [ ] Create test product
- [ ] Create test engagement
- [ ] Upload sample scan result (any format)
- [ ] View findings
- [ ] Check that background tasks work (Celery)

### 10. Configuration Finalization
- [ ] Change admin password (first login or Settings â†’ Users)
- [ ] Configure email settings (if needed)
- [ ] Set up additional users
- [ ] Configure notification settings
- [ ] Review security settings

### 11. Security Hardening
- [ ] Update DD_ALLOWED_HOSTS from `*` to actual domain
- [ ] Verify DD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS includes your Render URL
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin account
- [ ] Review and configure user roles
- [ ] Set up IP allowlisting if needed (Render dashboard)

### 12. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up external uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation (if desired)
- [ ] Review Render metrics dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts for service downtime
- [ ] Document backup procedures

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### Service Won't Start
- [ ] Check build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify all required files copied to container
- [ ] Check environment variables are set
- [ ] Review init logs for PostgreSQL errors
- [ ] Verify disk mount is healthy

### Health Check Failing
- [ ] Check if initialization is still running (wait 3 minutes)
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL is running (check logs)
- [ ] Verify Redis is running (check logs)
- [ ] Check uwsgi/Django is responding (check logs)
- [ ] Verify nginx is running (check logs)

### Login Issues
- [ ] Verify admin password is set correctly
- [ ] Check DD_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS includes your URL
- [ ] Check DD_ALLOWED_HOSTS includes your domain
- [ ] Clear browser cookies/cache
- [ ] Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Static Files Not Loading
- [ ] Check logs for collectstatic errors
- [ ] Verify nginx config has correct paths
- [ ] Check file permissions in container
- [ ] Verify DD_INITIALIZE=true on first run
- [ ] Try accessing /static/admin/css/base.css directly

### Database Connection Errors
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1`
- [ ] Verify DD_DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL logs: `/app/logs/postgresql.log`
- [ ] Verify disk mount is healthy
- [ ] Check database was created: `psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -l`

### Celery Not Processing Tasks
- [ ] Check celery-worker logs
- [ ] Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 ping`
- [ ] Check DD_CELERY_BROKER_URL is set
- [ ] Check environment variables loaded in supervisord
- [ ] Try restarting celery: `supervisorctl restart celery-worker`

## Validation Commands

Run these in Render Shell (Dashboard â†’ Shell tab):

```bash
# Check all services
supervisorctl status

# Check PostgreSQL
pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 && echo "PostgreSQL OK" || echo "PostgreSQL FAIL"

# Check Redis
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 ping && echo "Redis OK" || echo "Redis FAIL"

# Check Django
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:3031/login && echo " - Django OK" || echo " - Django FAIL"

# Check nginx
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:10000/login && echo " - nginx OK" || echo " - nginx FAIL"

# Run full health check
/health-check.sh && echo "All services healthy" || echo "Health check failed"

# Check environment variables loaded
cat /etc/environment.dd

# Check Django can connect to database
cd /opt/django-DefectDojo && python3 manage.py check --database default
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… All checklist items completed  
âœ… Service status: "Live" (not restarting)  
âœ… Health check: Passing  
âœ… Can login and navigate DefectDojo  
âœ… Can upload scan results  
âœ… Background tasks processing (Celery)  
âœ… Static files loading correctly  
âœ… No errors in logs (warnings OK)  
âœ… Response times acceptable (<1s for most pages)  

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails critically:

1. **Stop the service** (Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Delete Service)
2. **Review logs** to identify root cause
3. **Fix issues** in code
4. **Test locally** with Docker if possible
5. **Redeploy** with fixes

Note: Render disk persists between deploys, so database data is safe.

## Post-Deployment Maintenance

### Daily
- [ ] Check service is "Live"
- [ ] Review error logs for anomalies

### Weekly
- [ ] Review disk usage (Dashboard â†’ Metrics)
- [ ] Check for failed Celery tasks
- [ ] Verify backups are working

### Monthly
- [ ] Update DefectDojo to latest version
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets if needed
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Review user access and permissions

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Performance review
- [ ] Capacity planning (disk, plan size)
- [ ] Disaster recovery test
