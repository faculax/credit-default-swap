# Story 04: NFR Backlog

**As a** product owner  
**I want** a structured backlog of non-functional requirements (NFRs)  
**So that** we can prioritize resilience, performance, security, and observability work alongside features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Backlog file or tracking board created with initial NFR items
- [ ] Each NFR tagged with category (security, performance, reliability, compliance, operability)
- [ ] NFRs mapped to responsible owner/team
- [ ] Review cadence defined (e.g. bi-weekly)
- [ ] Added to planning rituals (referenced in sprint planning)

## Initial Categories (Seed)
- Security hardening
- Policy enforcement
- Data lineage maturity
- Telemetry coverage
- Code quality & debt metrics

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `NFR_BACKLOG.md` or project board
- [ ] Populate seed NFRs from epic
- [ ] Add ownership column/tag
- [ ] Define prioritization rubric (impact vs effort)
- [ ] Communicate location to team

## Implementation Notes
- Use GitHub Projects or simple markdown list initially
- Consider adding severity/impact levels (High/Med/Low)

## Test Scenarios
- Verify backlog visible to all engineers
- Confirm at least 10 starter NFRs registered
- Simulate review meeting referencing backlog

## UI / UX Acceptance (Provisional)
- None (process artifact only)

## Traceability
