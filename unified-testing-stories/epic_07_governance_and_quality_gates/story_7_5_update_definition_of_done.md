# Story 7.5 - Update Definition of Done and Review Checklists

**As a** scrum master  
**I want** the Definition of Done, review checklists, and onboarding materials updated for the new governance rules  
**So that** teams understand expectations before stories are marked complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Definition of Done document updated to include story-to-test traceability, coverage thresholds, and reporting requirements.
- Code review checklist revised with explicit items for story tagging and Allure artifact verification.
- Onboarding materials (slides, wiki pages) refreshed to reflect new policies.
- Communication plan executed (team meetings, announcements) to socialize updates.
- Confirmation recorded from each squad lead acknowledging receipt and understanding.

## Implementation Guidance
- Collaborate with product and QA leadership to ratify changes before publication.
- Store updated documents in version controlled location with clear revision history.
- Provide FAQ section addressing common questions about enforcement.

## Testing Strategy
- Peer review updated documents with cross functional stakeholders.
- Survey or retro feedback collected after rollout to ensure clarity.
- Schedule future review to assess adherence and adjust as needed.

## Dependencies
- Depends on enforcement mechanisms from Stories 7.1 through 7.4 being available for reference.
