# Story 8.4 - Run Rollout Workshops and Office Hours

**As a** platform adoption lead  
**I want** scheduled workshops and office hours for the unified testing rollout  
**So that** teams receive hands-on guidance and can ask questions in real time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Rollout schedule created covering live workshops, recorded sessions, and recurring office hours.
- Agenda covers core topics: tagging workflow, local CLI, CI expectations, troubleshooting playbook.
- Attendance tracked and recordings/slides shared via repository or knowledge base.
- Feedback survey distributed after sessions with results summarized for leadership.
- Action items captured and tracked for any unanswered questions or requested enhancements.

## Implementation Guidance
- Coordinate with team leads to avoid delivery clashes with major releases.
- Use interactive demos showing live test tagging and Allure report navigation.
- Provide sign-up or calendar invites with reminders.

## Testing Strategy
- Pilot session with small group to gather initial feedback before wider rollout.
- Review survey results to ensure satisfaction targets met (for example 80 percent positive).
- Adjust content or cadence based on feedback loops.

## Dependencies
- Requires documentation and tooling from Stories 8.1 through 8.3 to be ready for demonstration.
