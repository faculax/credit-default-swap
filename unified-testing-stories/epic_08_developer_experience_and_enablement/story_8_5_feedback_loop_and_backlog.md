# Story 8.5 - Establish Feedback Loop and Enhancement Backlog

**As a** platform product owner  
**I want** a repeatable process for collecting, triaging, and prioritizing feedback on the unified testing platform  
**So that** the tooling continues to evolve with team needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Feedback intake channels defined (for example GitHub Discussions, dedicated Slack channel, or issue labels).
- Triage cadence established with documented owners and SLAs for response.
- Enhancement backlog created in project tracking tool with categorization (tooling, docs, governance).
- Monthly or sprint review includes platform update highlighting addressed feedback and upcoming work.
- Metrics tracked for feedback volume, resolution time, and satisfaction (if survey data available).

## Implementation Guidance
- Publish instructions on how to submit feedback and what information to include.
- Use labels or project boards to distinguish bugs from enhancements.
- Align backlog prioritization with quarterly planning and platform roadmap.

## Testing Strategy
- Trial run feedback process during pilot rollout and adjust based on participant experience.
- Review backlog hygiene periodically to ensure items have clear next steps.
- Collect satisfaction data after first review cycle to measure effectiveness.

## Dependencies
- Builds on enablement materials and workshops from Stories 8.2 through 8.4.
