## Upgrade Notice

You may see a message about upgrading to SonarQube 2025.1. This is **optional** - your current LTS version is:
- ✅ Fully supported
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Receives security updates
- ✅ Perfect for CDS Platform needs

## Should You Upgrade?

### **Stick with Current LTS** if:
- ✅ Everything is working fine (recommended)
- ✅ You want maximum stability
- ✅ You prefer fewer updates
- ✅ You're just getting started

### **Upgrade to 2025.1** if you want:
- 🤖 Advanced AI capabilities
- 🔒 Latest security features
- 📈 Enhanced developer experience
- 🆕 New language features

## How to Upgrade (If Desired)

### Option 1: Easy Update (Recommended)
```powershell
# Stop current SonarQube
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sonarqube.yml down

# Edit docker-compose.sonarqube.yml
# Change: image: sonarqube:lts-community
# To:     image: sonarqube:2025.1-community

# Pull new version and start
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sonarqube.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sonarqube.yml up -d
```

### Option 2: Stay on LTS (No Action Needed)
The LTS version receives updates automatically within its version track. You don't need to do anything.

## Our Recommendation: **Keep LTS** ✅

For the CDS Platform, we recommend **staying on LTS** because:
1. **Stability** - LTS versions are battle-tested
2. **Long-term support** - Guaranteed updates for years
3. **Less breaking changes** - Smoother experience
4. **Your current setup works perfectly!**

## Current Configuration

Your `docker-compose.sonarqube.yml` is correctly set to:
```yaml
image: sonarqube:lts-community
```

This will automatically pull the latest **LTS** updates while maintaining version stability.
