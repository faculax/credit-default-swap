## Objective
Validate preparatory steps for batch pricing (preloading curves, caching schedules) improve performance metrics.

| FT-14-15-007 | Performance p95 after optimization | Engine | @PERFORMANCE |
| FT-14-15-008 | Concurrency multi-preload stability | Engine | @CONCURRENCY |
| FT-14-15-009 | Edge large batch still optimized | Engine | @SCALING |
| FT-14-15-010 | Contract batch pricing schema stable | Contract | @CONTRACT |
| FT-14-15-011 | Export optimization report JSON | API | @EXPORT |
| FT-14-15-012 | Fallback on cache miss | Engine | @RESILIENCE |

## Automation Strategy
Run batch with and without optimizations; compare latency; export report.
