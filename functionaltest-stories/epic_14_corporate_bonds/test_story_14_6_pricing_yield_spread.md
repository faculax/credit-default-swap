## Objective
Validate pricing engine computes clean price, dirty price, yield to maturity, and Z-spread accurately.

| FT-14-6-010 | Accessibility pricing UI | E2E | @ACCESSIBILITY |
| FT-14-6-011 | Concurrency multi-pricing requests | API | @CONCURRENCY |
| FT-14-6-012 | Edge negative yield (market stress) | Engine | @EDGE |
| FT-14-6-013 | Edge very short maturity | Engine | @EDGE |
| FT-14-6-014 | Edge very long maturity | Engine | @EDGE |

## Automation Strategy
Pricing harness vs baseline JSON; concurrency stress; negative yield scenario injection.
