# Functional Test Story 5.6 â€“ Compression Proposal Ingestion & Execution

Trace: story_5_6_compression_proposal_ingestion_execution
Tags: @EPIC_05 @STORY_5_6 @LIFECYCLE @COMPRESSION

## Objective
Validate ingestion, validation, and execution of compression proposals reducing gross notional while preserving net risk.
